    1's compliment -> preform flip to find 1's compliment / change value 0->1 and 1->0

    find 1's compliment of (1001)2

        (1001)2 1's compliment -> (0110)2

        
    2's compliment -> first find 1's compliment and than add 1.

    find 2's compliment of (1101)2

    1. 1's compliment -> (1101)2 - (0010)2
    2. Then add 1 in 1's compliment
        (0010)2 -> 0010 + 1 -> 0011

        so the 2's compliment of (1101)2 is (0011)2
